# ManuelObjectVanish - AI-Powered Object Removal Tool (From Scratch)

> **This project implements a content-aware image resizing and object removal algorithm (Seam Carving) from scratch, without using any high-level image processing libraries for the core logic.**

## 🚀 Project Overview

**ManuelObjectVanish** is an advanced computer vision project that implements **Seam Carving** (Content-Aware Image Resizing) algorithm for intelligent object removal from images. The core algorithm is developed **from scratch** using only NumPy for array operations and OpenCV for basic image I/O. This project demonstrates cutting-edge image processing techniques and is ideal for learning, teaching, and showcasing algorithmic skills in AI/ML recruitment processes.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## 🔧 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ManuelObjectVanish.git
   cd ManuelObjectVanish
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python -c "import cv2, numpy; print('Installation successful!')"
   ```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

1. **Prepare your images:**
   - Place your input image in the project directory
   - Create or obtain a binary mask for the object you want to remove

2. **Run the segmentation script:**
   ```bash
   python segmentation.py
   ```

3. **Generate masks (if needed):**
   ```bash
   python generate_mask.py
   ```

### Example Workflow

```python
# Load image and mask
image = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg')
mask = cv2.imread('your_mask.jpg', cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)

# Process the image
energy_matrix = compute_energy(image)
reweighted_energy = reweight_energy(energy_matrix, mask)
result = iterative_object_removal(image, mask, reweighted_energy)

# Save the result
cv2.imwrite('output.jpg', result)
```

## 🔬 Core Algorithms

### 1. Energy Computation
- **Horizontal/Vertical Gradients**: Computes image gradients using Sobel operators
- **Energy Matrix**: Combines gradients to create energy map for seam detection

### 2. Seam Carving
- **Dynamic Programming**: Finds optimal vertical paths with minimum energy
- **Path Removal**: Iteratively removes seams to eliminate target objects
- **Image Restoration**: Adds back seams to maintain original dimensions

### 3. Mask-Guided Processing
- **Binary Masking**: Uses masks to identify target objects
- **Energy Reweighting**: Prioritizes object removal by setting mask energy to zero
- **Iterative Refinement**: Continues until object is completely removed

## 🎨 Use Cases

- **Photo Editing**: Remove unwanted objects from photographs
